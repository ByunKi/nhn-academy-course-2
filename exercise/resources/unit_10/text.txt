This program will ask you to select an input file.
It makes a list of all the words that occur in the file
along with the line number of each line that contained
that word.  This is called a "concordance" for the file.
After reading the input file, the program asks you to
select an output file.  If you select a file, the list of
words will be written to that file; if you cancel, the list
be written to standard output.  All words are converted to
lower case.

Press return to begin.
